Recent Electronics and Computer technologist grad, returning for an Conmputer engineering degree.

Enjoy programming, learned a little about <br>
C, C++, Python, and VHDL<br>
through my program. Trying to improve my skills.<br>

I recently got into 3d printing and am learning the basics of 3d modeling and how to tune a 3d printer. I am also interested in SDR's and am currently using Unitrunker and DSD+ to learn more about Project 25 and trunked radio in general.


Currently going through FreeCodeCamps HTML/CSS for my covid staycation.
